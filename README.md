# Automated-Attendance-System

Automated Attendance System Project
This project is an automated attendance system implemented in Python. It utilizes computer vision techniques to automate the process of recording attendance for a group of individuals.

## Overview
The automated attendance system utilizes face recognition and image processing techniques to identify and record attendance. It captures facial features, matches them with pre-registered individuals, and logs their attendance accordingly.

## Features
Face detection and recognition for attendance logging.

Registration of individuals with associated IDs.

Automatic attendance logging to a database or file.
